# Hello

Welcome to our project: included are two of our separate products, A website and a web scraping tool.
# Website 
The majority of this repository is formed from code for the Website which has been developed with a full stack approach:
python manages the backend,
Flask is used to display Web assets,
HTML is used to form the site structure,
CSS gives the site color and styling,
and a small touch of java is used to glue elements together.

**Use the Start_server_main.py script to start the web-server running at localhost port 5000.**

# Web Scraper

This repisotory also houses a web scraper consisting of 3 files:


-----  Webscraper.py - this is the brains of the scraper which executes the logic. Run this file to begin scraping,

-----  chromedriver.exe - this executable helps link the selenium package to your Chrome browser instance,

-----  Scraped_data.csv - stores the result of the web scraping.
